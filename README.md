> In software engineering, every application requires a certain level of correctness; most of them are "tested" against some test suites, however, this turn out not to be sufficient for some application; this is because those test suites cannot "guarantee" 100% correctness. To solve such a problem, we need to "prove" that those applications are indeed correct. One way to formally verify it is to use dependent type theory where mathematical proof and computer program are the same things.
>
> In this workshop, I would like to walk though dependent type theory by first, describe it as a functional programming, then how can we use this functional programming to do some logical reasoning. No background knowledge is required (apart from simple maths skill in secondary school), so everyone is welcome to attend. We will speak in Thai but every written material will be in English. There will be no registration fee, but please bring your food.

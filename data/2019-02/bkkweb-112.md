# BKK WEB #112 - Application Stack for The Decentralized Web

> With the advent of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Blockchain hype there is a much needed understanding of the underlying technology. Today we will explore the facets of a dApp (decentralized apps) from the eyes of a developer. 

You will understand not only the problem domain and the benefits that web3.0 applications will enable, but how it works together from a technical architecture perspective. We will end with a quick demonstration of a working dApp and how you can start developing applications for the decentralized web.

What we will cover:

- What exactly is Web3.0 and dApp ?
- Whatâ€™s wrong with Web2.0 and importance of decentralization
- What is an architecture of a Fully decentralized apps and all its different components
- Short comings of modern Decentralized Apps (UX and Scalability) and the potential future application stack
- Quick dApp demo

# Unblock Bangkok - Game of Crypto Markets

> A GAME OF CRYPTO MARKETS

Weâ€™re kicking off the New Year strong taking lead from the official announcement on the list of licensed exchanges by the Security Exchange Commission on the 7th of January. In light of this recent development, local and global blockchain players will discuss the potentials in the Thailand market and how exchange players can tap into new opportunities. 

This upcoming Unblock meetup will bring together local and global blockchain players to explore the potential of the Thailand market and how exchange players can tap into new opportunities within the country.

# Ruby Wednesday #4

> Ruby Tuesday is an event to gather all who are interested in the programming language Ruby. Whether you're an expert or a beginner, you're welcome to join. There will be two short talks, with plenty of time to mingle and to meet other Ruby developers and friendly tech people.

We're having Ruby Tuesday on a Wednesday this month to work around the Visakha Bucha holiday! International software development company Nimbl3 will be hosting our meetup again for this month.

* Solving algorithmic problems in Ruby - Thai Pangsakulyanont
* Reducing Duplicate Code Using Model Concerns - Pathompon Jirawanidchakorn (Boat)

Ruby Tuesday is completely free to attend. Beverages and snacks will also be provided with compliments from Nimbl3. Help us build the Ruby community in Thailand. See you on the 30th!

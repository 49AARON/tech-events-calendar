# BKK WEB #107 â€” Tech for Non-Technical Entrepreneur

> In today world, software development has become essentials to every business. However, there are a lot of challenge and struggling with communication and misunderstanding between developer and company, customer or people outside the development team.

As the world of startup has grown, I often see non-technical entrepreneur struggling on how to start, establish and work with software development team.

In this talk, I aim to provide some fundamental concept and critical understanding of how to work and communicate with software development team effectively.

* What is difference between traditional and modern software development philosophy
* Agile principle and Lean Startup
* Outcome driven team
* Technical debt and why should you care
* Outsourcing vs In-house development

Chakrit Likitkhajorn (Chris) is currently working as Vice President of Engineering at Taskworld. He has experience in multiple areas in the software industry, including sales, pitching and programming.

See industry from multiple perspectives, he dreams of the world where everyone in every tech companies can work together effectively in peace, harmony and full alignment.

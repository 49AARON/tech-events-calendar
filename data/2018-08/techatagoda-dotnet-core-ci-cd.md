# Tech@Agoda Workshop: CI/CD .NET Core/React SPA

> 0 to 100, Building a full CI CD pipeline with free tools like GitHub, AppVeyor, etc. Hear from our favourite workshop host Cedric hands on about building your apps and deploying them in the cloud. Great for open and closed source projects.

In this session we're going to create and deploy an application end-to-end with software development best practices. This will include:

- Create a .NET Core, React SPA
- Host it in GitHub
- Write some unit tests (C# and TypeScript), just to get some good stuff for the next steps
- Build it in an automated CI
- Get code coverage report in GitHub Pull Request
- Get static code analysis report in GitHub Pull Request
- Get the application health (code smell, code quality...) dashboard
- Deploy it and run it

And all these will be done using the most popular and powerful open-source platform. That's right, you'll get a fully working application online by the end of this workshop.

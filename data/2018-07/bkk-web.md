# BKK WEB #106 â€” Applying Functional Programming in Everyday Web Development

> How could we practically apply the gist of functional programming in our everyday web projects without breaking a sweat?

Most of the things we do in software development involves transforming data from one form into another, and functional programming is one of the most natural way to do so elegantly and enjoyably.

However, it can also be quite intimidating to us developers. We will explore how we can naturally express our intentions and implement these foreign-looking functional concepts in our everyday web development.

So, instead of relying on mutation-heavy imperative programming, we could naturally express our intentions with the use of functional concepts.

On the other hand, our production software must be able to face the external world filled with side effects. We will explore how to efficiently tackle these impurities by borrowing various concepts from the functional realm.

* Why abstraction matters.
* What is Functional Programming?
* Functional Programming in nature.
* The composition of the web.
* Practical application in JavaScript.
* The Fun in Functional Web Development.
* Diving Deeper into Functional Programming.

Phoomparin Mano is only 16 yrs old but already a prodigy developer who loves the web, tinkers with cutting-edge technologies during the weekend, and passionate about creating software projects that enhance people's lives. In a very short time, Phoomparin acquired a quick reputation amongst the Thai developers and talked at various events, including larger conferences (including Tencent OpenHouse, JSConf.Asia, Barcamp Bangkehn 9...).

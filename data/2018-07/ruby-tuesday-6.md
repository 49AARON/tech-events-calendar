# Ruby Tuesday #6: Workshop Special!

> This month we're trying something new! We'll be holding a Ruby workshop. We'll have one session for beginners on the basics of Ruby, and a second session for intermediate developers focused on working with Rack, the library that supports Rails, Sinatra, and other web frameworks.

Ruby Tuesday is an event to gather all who are interested in the programming language Ruby. Whether you're an expert or a beginner, you're welcome to join.

As usual, there will be plenty of time to mingle and to meet other Ruby developers and friendly tech people.

Pizza and drinks at this month's meetup is sponsored by Gummy Bear Tech Recruitment, and the space has been generously donated by Launchpad.

Sessions:
- Beginning Ruby
- Writing Rack middleware

If you are also interested in presenting a topic for future Ruby Tuesday, contact us!

If your company is hiring, please do send us the information so we can help you spread the word.

Ruby Tuesday is completely free to attend. Help us build the Ruby community in Thailand. See you on the 31st!

What to bring:
- Please bring your laptop to participate in the workshop!

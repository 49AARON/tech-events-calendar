# Ruby Tuesday #3

> Tis the Songkran season for Ruby Tuesday! We have Nimbl3 who will be presenting a talk about “Mobile UI testing with RSpec and Appium” and Alyson Takai, developer from Oozou on “Planning and building a hackathon challenge in 4 hours.” Entrance is free!

Ruby Tuesday is an event to gather all who are interested in the programming language Ruby. Whether you're an expert or a beginner, you're welcome to join. International software development company Nimbl3 will be hosting our meetup for Ruby Tuesday #3.

As usual, there will be two short talks, with plenty of time to mingle and to meet other Ruby developers and friendly tech people. Light snacks and drinks will be provided.

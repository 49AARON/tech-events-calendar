# BKK WEB Meetup — Blind Spots/Ignored Opportunities In The Wider World (Marketing)

> The world’s largest economies are China, the US, Japan, Germany and so on - or are they?

The EU, added together as a grouped economy, is #2 in the world.

Making products for Germany? Do you focus only on them or other cold countries where people eat food out of metal tubes too?

People’s behavioral similarities are shared across national and linguistic boundaries, clearly. Group Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Singapore and The Philippines to make the third largest grouped economy in the world (sorry Japan) and forget how each is different, think how they’re alike.

How many businesses out of the Valley or Europe have problems here because of arrogance? They’re in a foreign language, they don’t offer localized invoice formats, they focus on their notions of scalability, friction, granularity - the list goes on and on.

Why is Uber on the rocks? Why did Pizza Hut hit the wall? Why did WhatsApp lose a near-monopoly? Why do people use “inferior” local apps? Are they really inferior if they’re dominating? Hmm.

Let’s talk about the wider world, how this arrogance creates huge amounts of opportunity and what to do about it.

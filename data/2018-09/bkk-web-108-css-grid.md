# BKK WEB #108 — CSS Grid: The Future of Layout, Today

> Rejoice! At long last, CSS Grid is here to revolutionize layout design for frontend web developers. Grid isn’t only more simple, flexible, and robust than any of its competitors, but it’s also a W3C standard. Oh, and it already ships with every major browser.

This talk will explore Grid from pipe dream to pipeline. We’ll motivate Grid by discussing its long list of predecessors, including Bootstrap and Flexbox. Then we’ll get dirty and code several Grid-based layouts.

The first demonstration will introduce audience members to Grid’s basic features. We’ll start by creating a simple sandbox to visualize two-dimensional templating, fractional units, and implicit rows. Then we’ll harness Grid’s advanced features to create something practical, reactive, and mobile-first.

Finally, we’ll adapt our creation to run on legacy browsers while we discuss progressive enhancement for Grid-based layouts.

- An Untimely Arrival: Why Grid is So Late
- Bootstrap Vs. Grid: Why Grid is Better
- Flexbox Review: A Preview of Grid
- Basic Grid: Two-Dimensional Templates, Fractional Units, Grid Lines
- Responsive Grid: Template Areas, Source-Order Independence, Grid w/ Media Queries
- Advanced Grid: auto-fit, minmax, grid-auto-rows
- Universal Grid: Backwards Compatibility, Progressive Enhancement, Grid w/ Feature Queries

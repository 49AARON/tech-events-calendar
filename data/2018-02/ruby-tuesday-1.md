# Ruby Tuesday #1

> Ruby Tuesday is an event to gather all who are interested in the programming language Ruby. Whether you're an expert or a beginner, you're welcome to join.

This will be our very first time holding at Link co-working space - see below for the address. There will be two short talks, with plenty of time to mingle and meet other Ruby developers and friendly tech people.

- Talk 1: Getting Started with Rails and Docker - Dan Itsara from Glazziq

- Talk 2: Coding with Ruby on Sketchup - Khun Yuthana Tubtimtong creator of Quicksketch, QuickNano, Qprecast & Qestimate

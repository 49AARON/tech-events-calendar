# BKK WEB #105 — Transitioning from Digital Agency to SaaS business

> What do you do when you have built up a 30 person digital agency but no longer love what you are doing? Lessons learned swapping clients for customers by building and running our own SaaS business. Stuff we tried along the way, what worked, and what flopped.

…Why now is the golden age for SaaS companies and how with your skills you are well placed to make the same transition.

* Background story
* Why clients suck
* Stuff we tried, what worked, what failed
* Going big or going home
* Getting to first million in revenue
* Lessons learned looking back
* Tips on how you can do it too

Luke likes to build stuff on the internets. He finds writing about himself in the 3rd person awkward and has no time for linkedin. You can find him on twitter or telegram as @lukeinth.

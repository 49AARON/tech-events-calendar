# iOSDevTH Meetup #12

> Area for meet up with iOS Developers in Bangkok (also Thailand)

* **“A brief summary of WWDC 2018” - Pitiphong, Omise** \
  Let's see what's new in the WWDC 2018 especially on the iOS platform. We'll walkthrough on many things announced in the WWDC 2018. Let's see what we can do in the iOS 12.

* **“Writing High-Performance Swift Code” - Thongchai, Rakuten Viki** \
  Thongchai (Hlung) will be sharing about dimensions of performance for Swift language, starting from the basics of allocation, reference counting, and method dispatch. Then he will share stories and ways the compiler can optimize our code and how we can take advantage of it. Finally, he will use Hopper disassembler to inspect how the compiler modifies our code.

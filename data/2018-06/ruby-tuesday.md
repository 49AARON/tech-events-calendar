# Ruby Tuesday #5

> Robin Clart, CTO from Omise ( Omise Payment) will be giving a talk this coming Ruby Tuesday on Double Entry Book Keeping. A very interesting topic not only for Ruby developers but all developers especially startups.

There will also be a panel discussion right after that on uses of Ruby that you might not know about.

We'll be at Launchpad on the 26th.

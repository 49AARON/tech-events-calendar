# Frontend Re-United Bangkok

> Come join us for an awesome day of sessions and networking! Enjoy our Morning Thai Session followed up by the LIVE STREAM from Holland until 20:00. You wont want to miss this huge opportunity!

Frontend United is a conference that yearly hosts 25 legendary speakers talking about UX, browser performance, theming, Javascript and Drupal. ​​​​​On the 1st June we will host our very own remote live stream event, in Bangkok! This means that we will be participating live, with Frontend United in The Netherlands.

We made sure everything is just like attending the conference in The Netherlands: T-shirts, booklets, a video-steam with an up-close of the speaker, and a room full of enthusiastic designers and developers :) We even have a direct line to ask the speakers questions, and we have our own social event.

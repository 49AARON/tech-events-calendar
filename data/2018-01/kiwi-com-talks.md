# Kiwi.com talks — Let’s talk about JavaScript beyond the web

> We are group of digital nomads from Kiwi.com travelling to Bangkok in January 2018 who would be pleased to share acquired knowledge about developing JavaScript apps with the others.

JavaScript world has exceeded the limits of browser environment and it's present in backend & mobile app world as well. Come and hear what we have learned so far while using latest technologies like Next.js, GraphQL or React Native.

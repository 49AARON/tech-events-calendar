# ThoughtWorks Talks Tech: Transforming and Improving Operations with DevOps

> ThoughtWorks is proud to present the next instalment of our tech talks series, this time with a DevOps theme and special guests!

We believe that developers should be able to enjoy building high quality software in an efficient and cost-effective way, with minimal human dependencies. How do we create an environment that minimises time and resource wastage, and optimise for productivity in a delivery team? Topics in these talks will range from the transformation to an automated infrastructure, how to prepare teams and organisations for success, how to survive the wild west of legacy systems and migrate to an automated world of daily deploys.

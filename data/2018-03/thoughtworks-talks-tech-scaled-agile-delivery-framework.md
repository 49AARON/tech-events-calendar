# ThoughtWorks Talks Tech: Scaled Agile Delivery Framework with Joanne Molesky

> Knowledge over recipe is the concept of building an adaptable, learning organisation that can understand and respond to the changes around it, optimising the flow of value to customers, a Lean Enterprise.

This framework provides a reference that will help turn an organization to Being Agile and Lean through learning and knowledge, instead of just Doing Agile and Lean through mass training and ritual adherence. The essence of being Agile and Lean depends on the entire organizationâ€™s ability to work in a collaborative manner to recognize when change is required and being able to implement required changes in a timely manner.

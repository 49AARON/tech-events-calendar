# ThoughtWorks Talks Tech: Scaled Agile Delivery Framework with Joanne Molesky

> Knowledge over recipe is the concept of building an adaptable, learning organisation that can understand and respond to the changes around it, optimising the flow of value to customers, a Lean Enterprise.

This framework provides a reference that will help turn an organization to Being Agile and Lean through learning and knowledge, instead of just Doing Agile and Lean through mass training and ritual adherence. The essence of being Agile and Lean depends on the entire organizationâ€™s ability to work in a collaborative manner to recognize when change is required and being able to implement required changes in a timely manner.

Joanne Molesky is a Principal Consultant with ThoughtWorks, where she provides consulting services to clients in the area of continuous delivery and process improvement. Joanne is co author (with Jez Humble and Barry O'Reilly) of the book [Lean Enterprise](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425), which addresses the fallacies of traditional management practices that often promote "being busy" instead of generating (financial) value quickly and sustainably. The principles and practices described in the book aim at creating alignment and enabling autonomy not only in engineering departments but also across financial management, program management, governance and process improvement areas.

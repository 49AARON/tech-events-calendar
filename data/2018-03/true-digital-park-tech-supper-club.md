# True Digital Park | Tech Supper Club #1: “The Future of Crypto”

> Forget about the price of Bitcoin for a second. Join us for an exclusive fireside chat with Jun Hasegawa and Paul Ark (Polapat Arkkrapridi).

How is blockchain changing the world? What are the use cases? What to expect from cryptocurrencies in 2018? Will this new digital economy stay or go bust?

Explore these questions together in this casual gathering. The session will be conducted in English and take around 1 hour, followed by networking session.

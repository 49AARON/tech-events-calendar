# Data Science BKK #4

> DS:BKK wants to step it up a notch and presents you a talk on real-time bidding (RTB).

Have you ever heard Cloudera founder Jeff Hammerbacher said the following?

"The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks."

Well, we agree wholeheartedly with the first sentence and not necessarily the second. So if you want to know WHY and HOW the best minds of our generation are "making people click", don't miss this meetup!

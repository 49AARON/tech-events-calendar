# Ruby Tuesday #2

> Ruby Tuesday is an event to gather all who are interested in the programming language Ruby. Whether you're an expert or a beginner, you're welcome to join.

There will be two short talks, with plenty of time to mingle and meet other Ruby developers and friendly tech people.

- Talk 1: Michael Kohl - What's new on Rails 5.2

- Talk 2: Khun Prayoot (topic to be confirmed)
